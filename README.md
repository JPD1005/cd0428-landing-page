# Landing Page Project

This project incomporates elements from HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create a landing page that is responsive to different screen sizes, and actively changes as you scroll through the page. It also scrolls for you by clicking the sections on the navigation bar on top.

## Getting Started

To run the code, simply double-click the `index.html` file inside the main folder, and it should display a preview automatically inside your default browser.

### Or alternatively:

* Right Click `index.html`
* Select "Open With"
* Choose your preferred Internet Browser
